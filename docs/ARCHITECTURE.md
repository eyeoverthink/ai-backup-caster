# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview
The podcast generation system is built using a modern web stack with AI integration.

### Core Components

#### Frontend
- Next.js for the React framework
- React components for UI
- Form handling with react-hook-form
- Toast notifications for user feedback

#### Backend
- Convex for backend functionality
- OpenAI integration for:
  - Content generation (GPT-4)
  - Text-to-speech conversion
- File storage system for audio files

### Key Workflows

#### Podcast Generation Process
1. User inputs prompt and selects voice
2. GPT-4 generates podcast content
3. Content is converted to speech
4. Audio file is stored
5. URL is generated for playback

#### File Management
- Audio files stored in Convex storage
- Unique IDs generated for each file
- URL generation for playback

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Content Generation (GPT-4) → Text-to-Speech → File Storage → Playback URL
```

### Security Considerations
- API keys stored securely
- File access controlled through Convex
- User authentication for podcast creation

### Performance Considerations
- Async processing for long-running tasks
- Efficient file storage and retrieval
- Optimized audio file handling

### Video Processing Integration

#### Components
- Rapid API integration for video processing
- Video download functionality
- Integration with existing sidebar navigation

#### Video Processing Workflow
1. User inputs video URL
2. Request sent to Rapid API
3. Video information retrieved
4. Download link generated
5. Optional: Video preview and processing

#### Updated Data Flow
```
Podcast Flow:
User Input → Content Generation (GPT-4) → Text-to-Speech → File Storage → Playback URL

Video Flow:
Video URL → Rapid API Processing → Video Information → Download Link Generation → User Download
```

#### Additional Security Considerations
- Rapid API key management
- Video URL validation
- Download link security

#### Additional Performance Considerations
- Video processing timeouts
- Download size limitations
- API rate limiting handling
